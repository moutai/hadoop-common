Market-aware Apache Hadoop common: HADOOP-MA

The emergence of auction-based clouds presents a new set of challenges for static fault tolerance techniques, such as the ones employed in the Hadoop framework. In auction-based clouds the availability of compute nodes is based on temporally fluctuating market prices. The main challenge is that, in the event of a market-based failure, the native Hadoop's fault tolerance can slow down a job progress significantly. In this paper, we present a Hadoop extension (i.e. Hadoop-MA) that improves Hadoop's market awareness. This proposed Hadoop extension continuously monitors the cloud market and gives feedback to the Hadoop job tracker to adjust dynamically its internal fault tolerance mechanisms. We show that this extension can improve the runtime of Hadoop jobs, under market-based failures, compared to native Hadoop fault tolerance mechanisms.
